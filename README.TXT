In the original version, commands like "go" and "quit" were hard-coded all over the Game class at the start (first commit of the project), which means that if we wanted to change "go" to "aller", like I did in the zuul-enums version, we'd have to search for every if(commandWord.equals("go")) and update it manually. 
In the enums version, the words that players type are isolated inside CommandWords, which means that the rest of the game just works with the internal enum values, like "CommandWord.GO/QUIT/etc, which never change. (The concept that we leaned in class, "loosely coupled", applies here. We can make changes to one class without affecting how another class works.)
